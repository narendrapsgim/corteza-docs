= Cases

There are three pages dedicated to cases -- one main page and two subpages.
They all show leads but with different filtering.

* *Cases* shows all of the cases in the system,
* *All New cases* shows only the cases that have the `New` status,
* *My new cases* shows only the new cases that you are responsible for.

Cases are the main component of {PRODUCT_NAME} Service Solution -- this is where all of the customer issues are captured and handled.

. A client contacts the company with an issue,
. the service agent checks the clients account to see if their entitlements permit support for the issue,
. if the client is entitled to support, a new case is created, directly from the account page,
. the agent inserts any relevant parameters to the case, assigns a category (the default is "Problem"), links any related products, contacts, and assigns an agent,
. the assigned agent works on the case, creates updates and finally closes the case.
